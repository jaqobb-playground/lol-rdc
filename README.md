LoLRegionCopier
=========

A console program that aims to make copying League of Legends region data (for example from the European/American client to the Korean one) easier, simpler and faster.

Project is not likely to receive any more changes. Project itself was supposed to make i.e. playing on Korean language but EU servers easier but this solution no longer works and recent game updates made this easier to do without having to copy anything.
